Habit_Tracker

Creating my first Console App in C#:


<H4>Requirements</H4>

    1. This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
    2. This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
    3. The application should store and retrieve data from a real database.
    4. When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
    5. It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
    6. The app should show the user a menu of options.
    7. The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
    8. You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
    9. The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
    10. You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
    11. Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.
